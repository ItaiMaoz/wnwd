# Coding Exercise Guidelines

## Critical First Steps
- Read requirements twice - ensure complete understanding before coding
- Ask clarifying questions upfront - don't assume
- Confirm expected input/output formats and edge cases
- Note time/space complexity requirements if mentioned

## Code Quality
- Write clean, self-explanatory variable/function names
- Keep functions small and single-purpose (SOLID principles)
- Avoid premature optimization - correct first, then optimize if needed
- Comment only complex logic, not obvious code

## Problem Solving Approach
- Start with brute force solution, then optimize
- Think through edge cases before coding (empty input, nulls, boundaries)
- Verify algorithm correctness with small examples on paper first
- Consider time/space complexity trade-offs explicitly

## Testing & Validation
- Test with provided examples immediately
- Add edge cases: empty, single element, max/min values, duplicates
- Test boundary conditions
- Verify output format matches requirements exactly

## Time Management
- Spend 5-10% of time planning before coding
- Get working solution first, refactor later if time permits
- Don't get stuck on one approach - pivot if blocked >10 min
- Leave time for testing and cleanup

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Off-by-one errors in loops/indices
- Integer overflow for large numbers
- Mutable vs immutable data handling
- Forgetting to handle null/undefined/empty inputs
- Misunderstanding 0-indexed vs 1-indexed requirements

## Communication (if live coding)
- Think aloud - explain your approach
- State assumptions explicitly
- Ask for hints if truly stuck (better than silence)
- Explain trade-offs when choosing data structures/algorithms

## Before Submitting
- Run all test cases one final time
- Check code compiles/runs without errors
- Remove debug prints/commented code
- Verify you answered the actual question asked
